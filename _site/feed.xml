It was around Christmas. GitHub Pages were not that prevalent back then. I wanted to move from using Tumblr to something that would feel a bit more like a personal website. So I thought of giving GitHub Pages a try.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that in mind, I started writing .html and .css files from scratch. I did not have much idea about frameworks like Bootstrap, or static-site generators like Jekyll, Pelican etc. But I was able to come up with something nice overnight and host that on GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started my blog at an intersection of electronics and coding, mostly on Arduino, Raspberry PI, robotics etc. It was fun. I enjoyed doing research and writing on stuff that would resonate with me. But somehow it got drifted away with time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it’s more like a reset! This time, I wish to keep this blog more focused on computer science (but of course not limited to it). I am particularly interested in how we can make a machine learn on its own and what we, as humans, can learn from it. I surmise it’s not a transition, but an evolution of my interest from robotics to something more fundamental. Hence I hope to write more on that, putting my perspectives on machine learning, as I dive deeper.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">I remember starting a blog in December 2013.
